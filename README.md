# Model_Based_VS_SRA_Stigmergy
Project to compare model-based agents and simple reflex agents (SRA) using stigmergy.

The goal is to get an overview of the difference in performance, as well as exploring further usages and models of stigmergy for SRAs. Overall, we want to investigate, if SRA can perform better in a defined transportation task than model-based agents, when they can use stigmergy.
